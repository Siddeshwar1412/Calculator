# Simple Web Calculator

A clean and responsive **Web Calculator** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It performs all basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage — through a user-friendly interface.

## How It Works

1. Click numeric buttons to input values.  
2. Use operators (+, -, *, /, %) to form expressions.  
3. Press `=` to evaluate the expression.  
4. Use `AC` to clear all input or `X` to delete the last digit.

## Learning Highlights

Through this project, I learned:
- How **JavaScript** manipulates DOM elements using `getElementById()`.
- Using `eval()` for expression evaluation and handling errors safely.
- Building responsive layouts with **CSS Grid**.
- Connecting HTML, CSS, and JS for functional frontend projects.
